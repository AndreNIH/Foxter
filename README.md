# Foxter

Foxter is a third-party tool that aims to enhance the functionality of the popular fanfiction website, [Archive of Our Own](https://archiveofourown.org). This project allows authors producing content for the platform, to set a date and time for [draft chapters](https://archiveofourown.org/faq/posting-and-editing?language_id=en#savedraft) of a story to be published, or in other words, to schedule draft chapter publishing.

## Donations

This program is completely free to use, however, developing it still took a considerable amount of time and effort. If you would like to support the project, and additionally show some appreciation, consider buying me a coffe (God knows I drink lots of it).
